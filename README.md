# Kubernetes PaaS Management Platform

## Overview

This project is a Kubernetes-based PaaS (Platform as a Service) management platform designed to simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of applications.

## Background

With the rise of microservices architecture, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration. This project provides a user-friendly Kubernetes PaaS management platform that helps developers and operations teams efficiently manage Kubernetes clusters and deploy applications.

## Features

- **Application Deployment**: Quickly deploy applications through a simple interface or command-line tools.
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically scale application instances based on load.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Real-time monitoring of application status and viewing logs.
- **User Management**: Supports multi-user and role-based access control.
- **Custom Resources**: Supports custom Kubernetes resources and operations.

## Architecture

The architecture of this project includes the following components:

- **User Interface**: Provides a web-based user interface for easy operation.
- **API Server**: Handles user requests and interacts with the Kubernetes API.
- **Database**: Stores user data, application configurations, and other information.
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Runs the user's applications and the management platform services.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (version 1.18 or higher)
- kubectl command-line tool
- Docker (for building and pushing container images)
- Helm (for Kubernetes application package management)
