# Kubernetes PaaS Management Platform

## Project Overview
This is a Kubernetes-based PaaS (Platform as a Service) management platform designed to simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of applications.

## Background
With the rise of microservices architecture, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration. This project provides a user-friendly Kubernetes PaaS management platform that helps developers and operations teams efficiently manage Kubernetes clusters and deploy applications.

## Features
- **Application Deployment**: Quickly deploy applications through a simple interface or command-line tools.
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically scale application instances based on load.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Real-time monitoring of application status and viewing logs.
- **User Management**: Supports multi-user and role-based access control.
- **Custom Resources**: Supports custom Kubernetes resources and operations.
